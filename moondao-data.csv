Preface
For the Chinese Community’s proposal workflow, we plan to take Space Postcards proposal as a example.
Workflow as follows:
Collect important proposal to the Proposal Group. (If there are Chinese members proposal it on Discord we won’t collect that)
Have discussion in proposal group.
Aggregate suggestions and finish the proposal draft.
Translate and check the final edition of proposal draft.
We adopt the practice of unified release of our final edition by core contributor from Chinese community @Richard, to increasing efficiency.",Weighted voting,"Mar 9, 2022, 11:29 AM","Mar 12, 2022, 11:29 AM",187,pmoncada.eth
